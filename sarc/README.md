# Code Compare - sarc

Comparing simple script/program in a few different programming languages.

## Bash

### Advantages

1. Executes very fast.
2. Easy access to other programs by shelling out.

### Disadvantages

1. It's confusing. The code does not, in my opinion, self document. You need to add comments to understand what exactly is happening.
2. Hard to know if it'll work cross platform. I'm writing this in bash, but another system could have bash scripts run by another interpreter. I also hard to remember what works in bash vs being POSIX compliant.
3. Not a lot of editor help. I can use shell check to get a bit of help, but I generally won't know if it works until I run it.

## Python

## JavaScript

## Golang

## PHP
